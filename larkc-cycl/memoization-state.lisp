(defmacro multi-hash (&rest hashes)
  "Combine fixnum hashes together, using platform-specific hashing. Should not cons."
  (reduce (lambda (x y) `(sb-int::mix ,x (sxhash ,y))) hashes))

;; DESIGN - as far as I can tell, the entire point of this caching-state stuff is to eliminate the need to cons up a list containing the params as a key to pass to gethash each time the function is called.  So the sxhash of the list of args is manually calculated without consing, then collisions are manually checked with the parameter values directly, using the TEST function on each parameter (note that this allows EQ or EQL slot testing within a composite key).  On a cache miss, the key is consed up to register it.  The zero parameter caching scheme is also broken out to its own storage slot.

;; This also stores the multiple-value-list of the calculation, instead of just a single return value.  TODO DESIGN - optimizing a route for single-value returns can save consing & speed

;; If these caches are hit a ton, consing up a list key to pass to gethash would add more GC pressure, and the steps through the code from the java looks shorter than what gethash does,although there is a gethash underlying the key->collisions storage.  The test seems to be part of the generated code (though I don't have a reference macro body to work from), so there's no unnecessary dispatch.  I think it's worth keeping this claptrap instead of just going for gethash for the moment.  As always, profiling needed.

;; Also, the caches can be selectively cleared, so having knowledge of which global variables hold the cahing states of various usages needs to remain exposed.

  ;; TODO DESIGN - This doesn't deal with arg-list keys, just a singular key object passed to the hashtable.  Grepping the source code, these always seem to be symbol keys.  This probably maps a function to a cached-state, which seems like a pointless lookup, given that the function name itself can create a symbol-value unique to hold the caching state anyway.  I'm tempted to rip all this out.
