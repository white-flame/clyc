;; DESIGN - abstracted the serious repetition and massive symbol names into a large macro. Hopefully this all works. I couldn't tell which macro this came from, so made my own.

;; TODO - this file has DO- macros for each iterator type in here. Implement them.

;; TODO - put warnings or deprecation in incomplete iterator definitions to ensure nobody uses them
