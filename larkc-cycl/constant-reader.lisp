;; Clyc hoists this file up earlier in the load order, so that the #$ is available everywhere.
;; This also splits up the behavior between read-time capturing of the name, and macro-expansion time resolving of the name, which defers this code from needing its dependencies compiled in.

;; Initial external dependencies:
;;  simple-reader-error
;;  valid-constant-name-char-p
;;  *read-suppress*
;;  reader-make-constant-shell
;;  *read-require-constant-exists*
;;  constant-complete-exact-name
;;  find-invalid-constant

  *read-require-constant-exists*)

;; TODO DESIGN - Compile-time side effects, like filling in the trie of constant names, do not get saved through to load time.  The biggest issue is that we can't easily use #$ in the fundamental source code to define constants at compile-time with this setup, although it would work for interactive use after the system is up and running.  For now, constants will be resolved at runtime.  Later, we could try performing existence checks at load-time, but we have to ensure that the world has been loaded first.
