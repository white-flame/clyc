;;  dynamic = can have dynamic bindings per thread
;;  reinitializing = if the code is (re)loaded, the initialization value overwrites the prior value.

;;  defglobal    = plain baseline variable, initialized once on creation
;;  deflexical   = reinitializing (eg, this file lexically "owns" the value dec)

;;  defparameter = dynamic + reinitializing (same as CL)
